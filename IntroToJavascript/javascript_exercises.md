#Variables

###The Age Calculator

Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

- Store the current year in a variable.
- Store their birth year in a variable.
- Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
-  Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

###The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

- Store your current age into a variable.
- Store a maximum age into a variable.
- Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
- Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
- Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

###The Geometrizer

Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

- Store a radius into a variable.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

###The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

#If/else

###What number's bigger?

- Write a function named greaterNum that:
  - takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
  - returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
- Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").

###The Grade Assigner

- Write a function named assignGrade that:
  - takes 1 argument, a number score.
  - returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
- Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

###The Pluralizer

- Write a function named pluralize that:
  - takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
  - returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".
- Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

#For loops

###The Grade Assigner

- Check the results of assignGrade function from the conditionals exercise for every value from 60 to 100 - so your log should show "For 89, you got a B. For 90, you got an A.", etc.

#Arrays

###Your top choices

- Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
- For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
- Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.
